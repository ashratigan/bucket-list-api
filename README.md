# Bucket List 

## Overview
This is the the backend for Bucket List, my first full-stack project. This is a single page application that allows people to create bucket lists. I  also created the front end for this project. 

Work on back end began by creating a database, then by creating tables. I created a bucketlist table that has the name of the bucket list and the tasks that someone wants to complete. I then linked the bucket list table to the users table, so when signed in, individual users can create, read, update, and delete their bucket lists.
